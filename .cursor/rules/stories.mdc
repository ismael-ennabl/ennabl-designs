Whenever we add a new component to our project, create a matching Storybook story file for it.
Use context7 to guide how the story should be written so it follows Storybook best practices.
Use designsystemsMCP to make sure the story includes the right design system variants, props, and accessibility notes.
The story should include clear usage examples, default args, and any important documentation.

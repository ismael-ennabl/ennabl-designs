Using the MCP TalkToFigma, Whether starting from Figma or starting from Cursor, always review all design details before finishing. you can use context7 MCP and designsystem MCP if available. 
Use the TalkToFigma plugin to read and apply every design token — including nested tokens — from the Figma file or Storybook project.
Check that all tokens are correctly mapped in the implementation, with no missing values. Especially doble check tables to render properly.
Always apply styles from my global theme CSS first, instead of default styles, so the final result matches my intended brand look.
Before finalizing, compare the implementation with both the Figma design and the Storybook story to confirm they match exactly in structure, style, and behavior.
